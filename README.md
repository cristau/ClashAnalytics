# ClashAnalytics

## Purpose

To develop a website that includes statistics on players and clans from the well-known mobile game [Clash of Clans](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/). Since there are many other websites that already do this (and admittedly, we are pretty late to the party), we wanted to include features that make this application *unique*. 

Some of these features include:

- Prediction analytics using ML models
- Custom algorithms to determine the most active players
- Clan scores to assess the health of a given clan 

This project is still in development (and will be for quite some time). 

### Database
We needed a cloud based yet virtually free SQL storage system, so we utilized [bit.io](https://bit.io/).
